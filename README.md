## Population simulations to understand how cohort resonance influences extinction risk in an example population

Investigations into how the frequency content of "important" environmental 
variables (i.e., local temperature or large-scale ocean-atmospheric forcing) 
interact with an age-structured population to influence extinction risk. 

Demographic rates, such as survival, fecundity, and maturation, respond to 
external environmental forcing and the resulting impact on (discrete) 
age-structured populations depends on several characteristics of the population 
in question. Number of age classes, spawning age distributions, extent of repeat 
spawning (i.e., semelparity vs. iteroparity).

Age-structured populations can act as "filters" of environmental variables that 
influence demographic rates and signal resonance depends on population
state.
